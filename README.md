# Bang2.0ProjectDB
Bang 2.0 Project Database: Aidan, Risa, Val, Mike
project plan:

Our goal is to have a site that will store all of the links to people’s projects, whether they be group projects or personal, and we want to collect them from as many people as possible. We would have an organization by period, (2-5) and we would also want to have a search engine, or a way to find the projects stored by name or by period. This is similar to a “database” of sorts, just much simpler.

Roles: Risa - Model
	Aidan - UI/Control
	Michael - (mostly)UI/Model 
	Val - Control (mostly)
	
	Week 1 Goal : Create a schedule that helps us stay on track and do some additional research on html.
	    we also want to find an efficient way to collect data without having to link an actual database, and still be able to collect info from different periods and groups.

Grades for Week 8: 

Aidan: 5/5 Great participation and helped me with researching how to pull data from a file. 
Got github working and was able to commit from the first time I explainned it to the group 
and was very helpful with project running smoothly.

Risa: 5/5 Perfect work done this week. Was able to get drop-down menu working and attended 
optional tutorial to help our project. She was also able to debug and fix minor errors in 
the code. Went above and beyond this week working on new ideas and topics, would give her 
more points if i could.

Mike: 3/5 Good participation, lacking tangible asset submission, and sometimes requires me
to explain something twice after explaining it to the group. Will work harder next week I 
hope to be more present in the code, not just in discussions.

Val: 5/5 Good participation and I helped navigate the team through transitioning into 
IntelliJ and I worked to answer everyone's questions as well as continuously update 
the repository with new resources and code. I familiarized myself with Jinja and Bootstrap
features, and found new ideas for next week.
