# Bang2.0ProjectDB
Bang 2.0 Project Database: Aidan, Risa, Val, Mike
project plan:

Our goal is to have a site that will store all of the links to people’s projects, whether they be group projects or personal, and we want to collect them from as many people as possible. We would have an organization by period, (2-5) and we would also want to have a search engine, or a way to find the projects stored by name or by period. This is similar to a “database” of sorts, just much simpler.

Roles: Risa - Model
	Aidan - UI/Control
	Michael - (mostly)UI/Model 
	Val - Control (mostly)
